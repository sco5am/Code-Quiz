# Code-Quiz

## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a timed Javascript quiz that would test users' knowledge of various javascript fundamentals. This Quiz starts when the user clicks the start button, from there the user is greeted with a ticking timer and a question with 4 multiple choice answers. When a user selects an answer, the code is written to subtract time from the timer if the user is wrong, or notify them of a correct answer and move on to the next question. At the end of the quiz the user will be able to save their score as well as their initials on a leaderboard.
 
This project helped me to better familiarize myself with javascript, specifically using getElementById, localstorage, and JSON.
